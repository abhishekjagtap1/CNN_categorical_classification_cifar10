# CNN for categorical classsification using Tensorflow backend
The attached ipynb file can be used for number of categorical classification.
dataset used is cifar10, consisting of 10 categories, training the network is discussed in the executable file.


The CIFAR-10 dataset is a collection of images of 10 different classes like cars, birds, dogs, horses, ships, trucks, etc. The idea of the project is to build an image classification model that will be able to identify what class the input image belongs to.
